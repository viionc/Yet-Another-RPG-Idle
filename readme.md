## TODO:
-   figure out how to fix battleInterval delay when players attack speed changes:
  
    (basically what happens is that whenever the attack speed changes, use effect that calls that interval gets updated, destroys the current interval, and creates a new one with an updated value which creates a delay equal to remaining time of previous interval)
-   fix damage hit splat update
-   fix overkill damage
-   unlock the requirements system
-   rework enemy xp, hp, and gold gain systems
